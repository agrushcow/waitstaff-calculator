    		<p>This is an app that helps you keep track of your earnings. In this panel, we simply are giving you an introuction to how this app is constructed. In the "new meal" panel you are able to input the details of a meal, including the base meal price, the tax rate and the tip percentage. This will calculate a total meal cost. In the third "my earnings" panel you can see the results of your earlier meal calculations. It keeps track of your tip total, the amount of meals you have kept track of and finally calculates the average tip you have received per meal.</p>
